# Crankshaft List Project
The Crankshaft List Website is a company website that has hundreds of free vehicle listings. This website displays various kinds of vehicle advertisements every day. For this reason, by studying the data that has been collected over the last few years, it can be used as analysis material for certain needs for the company in the future.

## Objective
This report was created with the aim of studying data that has existed for the past few years to find out how much other factors influence the price of a vehicle. Another goal is to study the data as a whole and find out what insights can be drawn from the data so that it can be used in the future or can be used as a guide for sellers in setting prices for the cars they advertise.
